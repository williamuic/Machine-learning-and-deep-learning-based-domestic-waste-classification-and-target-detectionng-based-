# Machine-learning-and-deep-learning-based-domestic-waste-classification-and-target-detectionng-based-
This is a project that use machine learning neural network and deep learning centerNet ResNet101 models to solve the classification problem of the domestic waste . 
Simple neural network model is in the ipynb file.
Deep learning model centerNet target detection is in the center files.
Our report shows the specific details in the models and the experimental results.
